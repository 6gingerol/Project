# My Personal Project: Enneagram Fighter RPG

## What will this application do?
It will allow the user to manage a roster of characters based on the nine Enneagram personality types. Users can equip characters with items, view character details, and engage in turn-based battles. Each Enneagram character type has unique stats and abilities reflecting their personality traits.

## Who will use it?
Anyone who has interest in Enneagram personality tests and RPG games. 

## Why is this project of interest to me? 
I've always been an avid fan of personality tests and especially the Enneagram. I find it fun to read all sorts of descriptions and catagorize my friends. I also really enjoyed playing RPG games when I was younger and so I thought it would be nice to combine two of my interests into a game.
